# Algorithm Questions

In this repo, we will be dealing with digits of integers and solving algorithmic questions.
We will create a class called <b>Digits</b>. We will write static methods for the Digits class.

1. Write a method named <b>digitZero</b> that gets an integer parameter n and returns its least significant digit. For example, if the parameter is 5786, the method should return 6.

2. Write a method named <b>digitFirst</b> that gets an integer parameter n and returns its first digit. For example, if the parameter is 5786, the method should return 5. 

3. Write a method named <b>digitAt</b> that gets two integers n and i as parameters (in this order). The method should return the ith digit of n. For example, if the parameters are 89745 and 2, the method should return 7. Note that the zeroth digit is 5, the first digit is 4 and the second digit is 7. 

4. Write a method named <b>digitSumLargerThan</b> that gets two integers n and limit as parameters (in this order) and returns the sum of the digits that are larger than the limit. For example, if the parameters are 889745 and 7, the method will return the sum of the digits that are larger than 7, that is 8+8+9 = 25. 

5. Write a method named digitCount that gets two integers n and digit as parameters (in this order). The method counts the number of digits in n that are equal to digit. For example, if the parameters are 4574172 and 7, the method should return 2. Note that 7 occurs 2 times in 4574172.
